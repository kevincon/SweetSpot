SweetSpot
=========

An accelerometer-based game for Android. Built at EA Code Wars 2014 by a bunch of hardware engineers.

The goal? Find the sweet spot. Keep rotating the phone to do so. The vibrator and speaker dings should help you along the way. You have 60 seconds to find as many as possible.
